Submit your recipe There are a few crucial steps to baking the chewiest, tastiest chocolate chip cookies. First, skip using chips and opt for chunks. Second, instead of using just one type of chocolate (like semisweet), use a mix of semisweet, milk, and dark chocolate. Third, take the time to allow the cookie dough to rest overnight in the refrigerator. Yes, we know it's a pain, but doing so will yield a cookie with a more complex flavor and delicious toffee notes. Lastly, use an ice cream scoop to portion the cookie dough onto the baking sheet. This will produce even-sized cookies every single time. Follow these simple steps, and you'll be rewarded with a cookie that's crisp and chewy on the outside and gooey on the inside! 1 hr 5 min 1 hr 5 min 20 minutes 20 min 15 minutes 15 min Inspired by buzzfeed.com 1 hr 5 min 1 hr 5 min 20 minutes 20 min 15 minutes 15 min for 12 cookies Estimated values based on one serving size. Build your cart with Tasty, then choose how you want to get your order from Walmart. I love this recipe so much!! I am NEVER using chocolate chips ever again! These cookies are decadent, chewy, and oh so delicious! I used light brown sugar and salted butter. I highly recommend this recipe to any chocolate chip cookie lover! if the cookies get hard, store them in and airtight bag or container with a slice of bread and they will become soft again soon I have made these about 4 times now! My tip is to not melt the butter until it\u2019s completely liquid, then whisk it until the soft butter is incorporated with the fully melted butter before adding. Also if you let the dough rest in the fridge for 3 hours or more, they get nice and toffee-like. The cookies were so delicious \ud83d\ude0b They were a little bigger than expected. I put the cookies on a nonstick pan instead of parchment paper and they still turned out fine. \ud83d\ude0d They were really easy to make. I\u2019m 12 \ud83d\ude02 100% I\u2019d make again! I bake them for 5 minutes less to avoid over cooking as they\u2019re cooling. This ensures they will still be soft after even a week of storage (if they last that long). I\u2019ve made this recipe twice now and I changed the recipe a tad bit. I added 1/4 cup more flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and I used 3/4 cup of nestle\u2019s dark chocolate chips . I let them hang out in the fridge for about 2 hours. I also preheated my oven to 375 and let them bake for 10 mins and took them out to sit about 5 min to finish. Be sure to get the right kind of chocolate! Not chocolate chips. Get the chunks! Trust me, it makes a difference. When I was incorporating the melted butter and sugars, it doesn\u2019t look the same like the one in the video. I continued the recipe but it ended up looking like cake batter, so I added 1/4 cup of flour and it turned out great! I recommend mixing chocolate chips and chocolate chunks for my diversity Use half melted butter and half soften butter that\u2019s makes a chewier cookie Way too sweet, use less sugar These cookies are LEGIT the best cookies i\u2019ve ever made! Have made them several times and they come out great every time. I use a bit less brown sugar and a bit more white sugar so the cookie will spread. Really good!

Our Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies are truly the best chocolate chip cookies around\u2014they\u2019re called \u201cultimate\u201d for a reason. Prefer your homemade chocolate chip cookies crispy and thin? Cut out the brown sugar completely, and increase the amount of granulated sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Granulated sugar contains less moisture and helps cookies spread as they bake. After taking your chocolate chip cookies out of the oven, let them cool on a cookie sheet for five minutes. The cookies will keep baking, allowing them to crisp up further as the moisture evaporates. If you want your chocolate chip cookies airy, soft and cakey, we\u2019ve got you covered. Add in an extra egg for additional moisture and structure, and add in 2 tablespoons of milk with the egg to help soften the dough as it bakes and give the cookie a cake-like crumb. Increase the amount of flour to 3 cups to help the cookies rise (rather than spread). The perfectly cakey chocolate chip cookie is just a few steps away!

UC Berkeley (link resides outside ibm.com) breaks out the learning system of a machine learning algorithm into three main parts. Explore the benefits of generative AI and ML and learn how to confidently incorporate these technologies into your business. Register for the white paper on AI governance Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it\u2019s worth noting the nuances between the two. Machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. However, neural networks is actually a sub-field of machine learning, and deep learning is a sub-field of neural networks. The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. \"Deep\" machine learning can use labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily require a labeled dataset. The deep learning process can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. This eliminates some of the human intervention required and enables the use of large amounts of data. You can think of deep learning as \"scalable machine learning\" as Lex Fridman notes in this MIT lecture (link resides outside ibm.com). Classical, or \"non-deep,\" machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn. Neural networks, or artificial neural networks (ANNs), are comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers\u2014which would be inclusive of the input and the output\u2014can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network. Deep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. See the blog post \u201c AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What\u2019s the Difference? \u201d for a closer look at how the different concepts relate. Explore the watsonx.ai interactive demo Download \"Machine learning for Dummies\" Explore Gen AI for developers Machine learning models fall into three primary categories. Supervised learning , also known as supervised machine learning, is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting . Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, na\u00efve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). Unsupervised learning , also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets (subsets called clusters). These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention. This method\u2019s ability to discover similarities and differences in information make it ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It\u2019s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this. Other algorithms used in unsupervised learning include neural networks, k-means clustering, and probabilistic clustering methods. Semi-supervised learning offers a happy medium between supervised and unsupervised learning. During training, it uses a smaller labeled data set to guide classification and feature extraction from a larger, unlabeled data set. Semi-supervised learning can solve the problem of not having enough labeled data for a supervised learning algorithm. It also helps if it\u2019s too costly to label enough data. For a deep dive into the differences between these approaches, check out \" Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning: What's the Difference? \" Reinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm isn\u2019t trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem. The IBM Watson\u00ae system that won the Jeopardy! challenge in 2011 is a good example. The system used reinforcement learning to learn when to attempt an answer (or question, as it were), which square to select on the board, and how much to wager\u2014especially on daily doubles. Learn more about reinforcement learning A number of machine learning algorithms are commonly used. These include: Depending on your budget, need for speed and precision required, each algorithm type \u2014supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement\u2014has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, decision tree algorithms are used for both predicting numerical values (regression problems) and classifying data into categories. Decision trees use a branching sequence of linked decisions that may be represented with a tree diagram. A prime advantage of decision trees is that they are easier to validate and audit than a neural network. The bad news is that they can be more unstable than other decision predictors. Overall, there are many advantages to machine learning that businesses can leverage for new efficiencies. These include machine learning identifying patterns and trends in massive volumes of data that humans might not spot at all. And this analysis requires little human intervention: just feed in the dataset of interest and let the machine learning system assemble and refine its own algorithms\u2014which will continually improve with more data input over time. Customers and users can enjoy a more personalized experience as the model learns more with every experience with that person. On the downside, machine learning requires large training datasets that are accurate and unbiased. GIGO is the operative factor: garbage in / garbage out. Gathering sufficient data and having a system robust enough to run it might also be a drain on resources. Machine learning can also be prone to error, depending on the input. With too small a sample, the system could produce a perfectly logical algorithm that is completely wrong or misleading. To avoid wasting budget or displeasing customers, organizations should act on the answers only when there is high confidence in the output. Here are just a few examples of machine learning you might encounter every day: Speech recognition: It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, and it is a capability which uses natural language processing (NLP) to translate human speech into a written format. Many mobile devices incorporate speech recognition into their systems to conduct voice search\u2014e.g. Siri\u2014or improve accessibility for texting. Customer service: Online chatbots are replacing human agents along the customer journey, changing the way we think about customer engagement across websites and social media platforms. Chatbots answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) about topics such as shipping, or provide personalized advice, cross-selling products or suggesting sizes for users. Examples include virtual agents on e-commerce sites; messaging bots, using Slack and Facebook Messenger; and tasks usually done by virtual assistants and voice assistants. Computer vision: This AI technology enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs, and then take the appropriate action. Powered by convolutional neural networks, computer vision has applications in photo tagging on social media, radiology imaging in healthcare, and self-driving cars in the automotive industry. Recommendation engines: Using past consumption behavior data, AI algorithms can help to discover data trends that can be used to develop more effective cross-selling strategies. Recommendation engines are used by online retailers to make relevant product recommendations to customers during the checkout process. Robotic process automation (RPA ): Also known as software robotics, RPA uses intelligent automation technologies to perform repetitive manual tasks. Automated stock trading: Designed to optimize stock portfolios, AI-driven high-frequency trading platforms make thousands or even millions of trades per day without human intervention. Fraud detection: Banks and other financial institutions can use machine learning to spot suspicious transactions. Supervised learning can train a model using information about known fraudulent transactions. Anomaly detection can identify transactions that look atypical and deserve further investigation. As machine learning technology has developed, it has certainly made our lives easier. However, implementing machine learning in businesses has also raised a number of ethical concerns about AI technologies. Some of these include: While this topic garners a lot of public attention, many researchers are not concerned with the idea of AI surpassing human intelligence in the near future. Technological singularity is also referred to as strong AI or superintelligence. Philosopher Nick Bostrum defines superintelligence as \u201cany intellect that vastly outperforms the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.\u201d Despite the fact that superintelligence is not imminent in society, the idea of it raises some interesting questions as we consider the use of autonomous systems, like self-driving cars. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that a driverless car would never have an accident, but who is responsible and liable under those circumstances? Should we still develop autonomous vehicles, or do we limit this technology to semi-autonomous vehicles which help people drive safely? The jury is still out on this, but these are the types of ethical debates that are occurring as new, innovative AI technology develops. While a lot of public perception of artificial intelligence centers around job losses, this concern should probably be reframed. With every disruptive, new technology, we see that the market demand for specific job roles shifts. For example, when we look at the automotive industry, many manufacturers, like GM, are shifting to focus on electric vehicle production to align with green initiatives. The energy industry isn\u2019t going away, but the source of energy is shifting from a fuel economy to an electric one. In a similar way, artificial intelligence will shift the demand for jobs to other areas. There will need to be individuals to help manage AI systems. There will still need to be people to address more complex problems within the industries that are most likely to be affected by job demand shifts, such as customer service. The biggest challenge with artificial intelligence and its effect on the job market will be helping people to transition to new roles that are in demand. Privacy tends to be discussed in the context of data privacy, data protection, and data security. These concerns have allowed policymakers to make more strides in recent years. For example, in 2016, GDPR legislation was created to protect the personal data of people in the European Union and European Economic Area, giving individuals more control of their data. In the United States, individual states are developing policies, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was introduced in 2018 and requires businesses to inform consumers about the collection of their data. Legislation such as this has forced companies to rethink how they store and use personally identifiable information (PII). As a result, investments in security have become an increasing priority for businesses as they seek to eliminate any vulnerabilities and opportunities for surveillance, hacking, and cyberattacks. Instances of bias and discrimination across a number of machine learning systems have raised many ethical questions regarding the use of artificial intelligence. How can we safeguard against bias and discrimination when the training data itself may be generated by biased human processes? While companies typically have good intentions for their automation efforts, Reuters (link resides outside ibm.com) highlights some of the unforeseen consequences of incorporating AI into hiring practices. In their effort to automate and simplify a process, Amazon unintentionally discriminated against job candidates by gender for technical roles, and the company ultimately had to scrap the project. Harvard Business Review (link resides outside ibm.com) has raised other pointed questions about the use of AI in hiring practices, such as what data you should be able to use when evaluating a candidate for a role. Bias and discrimination aren\u2019t limited to the human resources function either; they can be found in a number of applications from facial recognition software to social media algorithms. As businesses become more aware of the risks with AI, they\u2019ve also become more active in this discussion around AI ethics and values. For example, IBM has sunset its general purpose facial recognition and analysis products. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna wrote: \u201cIBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.\u201d Since there isn\u2019t significant legislation to regulate AI practices, there is no real enforcement mechanism to ensure that ethical AI is practiced. The current incentives for companies to be ethical are the negative repercussions of an unethical AI system on the bottom line. To fill the gap, ethical frameworks have emerged as part of a collaboration between ethicists and researchers to govern the construction and distribution of AI models within society. However, at the moment, these only serve to guide. Some research (link resides outside ibm.com) shows that the combination of distributed responsibility and a lack of foresight into potential consequences aren\u2019t conducive to preventing harm to society. Read more about IBM's position on AI Ethics Selecting a platform can be a challenging process, as the wrong system can drive up costs, or limit the use of other valuable tools or technologies. When reviewing multiple vendors to select an AI platform, there is often a tendency to think that more features = a better system. Maybe so, but reviewers should start by thinking through what the AI platform will be doing for their organization. What machine learning capabilities need to be delivered and what features are important to accomplish them? One missing feature might doom the usefulness of an entire system.
